# Real-Time Face Detection with OpenCV

This project uses **OpenCV** to perform real-time face detection from a webcam feed. It detects human faces in a video stream and highlights them with a bounding box.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV.
- Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.
- Press 'A' to exit the program.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV

## 📌 Installation
### 1️⃣ Install Python (if not installed)
Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### 2️⃣ Install Required Libraries
Run the following command:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

### 3️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-face-detection-opencv.git
cd real-time-face-detection-opencv
```

## ▶️ Usage
Run the Python script:
```bash
python face_detection.py
```
Press **'A'** to exit the application.

## 📸 Example Output
The script will open a webcam window and detect faces in real-time.

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- Ensure your webcam is enabled and accessible.
- This script only detects faces; it does not store any personal data.
